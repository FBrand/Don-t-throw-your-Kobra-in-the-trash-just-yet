# Don-t-throw-your-Kobra-in-the-trash-just-yet

If you feel similarly about your Anycubic Kobra and you are wondering if there are any parts worth salvaging or if you should just throw the whole thing in the trash and get a different Printer the following might help:

1. Delete the crippled Anycubic firmware.
2. Fix the broken stepper driver addressing by desoldering a 0-Ohm resistor and bridging the pins next to it.
3. Grab a Raspberry PI (2,3,4, zero2), old notebook, old pc or something else, that can run linux and install klipper onto it.
4. Flash klipper onto the printer.
5. Setup and tune Klipper.
6. Enjoy a printer that actually does what it is supposed to, prints models as expected by the designer and never bother with anycubic special solutions ever again (at least on the software side)


More details, instructions, and my klipper config comming soon...
